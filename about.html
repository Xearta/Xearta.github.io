<p>I’ve had a curiosity for computers since a young child. My earliest adventure into coding was in high school where I built a Minecraft wiki Android app using the Android SDK. Following that interest, I dabbled in web development on my own while studying computer science at a local community college. I really enjoyed web development and wanted to pursue that full-time. That’s when I found the Flatiron School. I started my studies at Flatiron where I spent my time learning as many new techniques and technologies as I could find. As someone who has utilized a lot of healthcare services, I’m excited to take my go-getter attitude & diverse skillset to make a real difference in the healthcare industry. </p>
