Being born with a heart defect helped put me on the path towards a career in Software Engineering. As a child, I was homebound more than others and unable to play most sports. This caused me to spend a lot of time on computers and gave a love for computers. At this point, I learned that I really would love to be able to create and work on projects that will benefit others or even society as a whole.  Along the years, I would spend a lot of time doing various little tricks and coding snip-its but I would typically fall flat when the programs got too complex. 

This led me to want to study Computer Science in college where I obtained an Associate's at a local community college. However, due to the structure of typical schooling, I didn't finish my Bachelor's. Also, I didn't like that college typically only teaches Java which isn't the programming language I wanted to learn. (*I will say that learning Java concepts has helped me understand other programming languages*)

#### Onwards to FlatIron!
Now begins my journey at FlatIron. I am approaching learning Software Engineering with a better growth mindset that I hope will help on my adventures.  Since teaching enforces learning, I strive to help out in Slack and answer any questions that I am able to do. I also plan to make it to any study sessions possible to help learn more. As I complete FlatIron School, I hope that I am able to create and work on projects that help society become a better place!
