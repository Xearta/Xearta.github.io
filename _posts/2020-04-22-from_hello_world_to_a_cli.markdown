I came from having prior experience with other programming languages so I was able to smoothly move through the labs. This caused me to feel a bit over confident when it came time for the CLI project. I came upon the project page, read through the project requirements, opened a fresh IDE and stared blankly at it. A sudden realisation hit. I wasn't sure how to actually start my project. 

I struggled to even come up with an idea, let alone an entire application. After pacing around for awhile, I came up with my idea to scrape the New York Times Best Sellers lists and display the list. Then, the user would be able to get more information about the books on the list if they so desire. Great! Now, how do I make this work? Well, I found a '[Scraper Checker](http://https://repl.it/@TheGingertonic/ScraperChecker)' Repl.it that allows you to see if a website is actually scrapable. My web site worked so I was ready to get started!

Back to the learn page I went to find Avi's video guide on getting started. I followed his guide and created my Git environment and ruby gem project folders. Then I found a sample project on the learn page which was very similar to what I was actually doing. Since programmers are *lazy*, I would use a lot of inspiration from the code on that project for my application. Thus, my application was formed.

I learned a lot from this project. I learned the importance of Git, the importance of looking this up, and the importance of learning from your mistakes. This project seemed very daunting at first but I was able to complete the project in just a few hours by stepping through each part of the project one at a time. I now feel that I am able to work on more projects with just a blank slate and that feels awesome!
